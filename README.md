# my_minecraft_datapacks

Place these file under your `<minecraft_app>/<saved_game>/datapacks` folder.

Launch minecraft and open your <saved_game>.

Type `t` and enter `/reload`.

## Mining

Type `/function drh:prep_mine`. This will excavate a few layers from Y 2 to Y 15, add some glass floors between, and leaving the non-ores to be mined.
